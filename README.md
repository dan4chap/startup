# Expenses Easy

[My Notes](notes.md)

This app will allow you to connect your bank accounts and track your expenses. For whatever reason, other apps that do this are hard to follow, only show one graph at a time and don't allow you to just see the basic transcation information that you want to. This app will focus on tracking expenses, allowing you to see your transactions on graphs; showing daily transactions or whatever time frequency the user desires. 

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

Expenses Easy lets you easily access your financial accounts, track expenses, and provide budgeting tools.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Worried about tracking your expenses? But every app makes no sense and you can't actually see what you want? Yeah I agree. Expenses Easy will let you see useful information about your bank accounts with a focus on your transaction history which will help you to track your expenses, and if wanted, start budgeting.

### Design

Simple diagram showing that the user will login, then access Plaid (the api that allows you to access your banking information), then see their charts and budgeting tools, and finally be able to use the chat to communicate with other users.
